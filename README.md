# Health Insurance Cost Estimation Project

In this project, I aim to develop a data science project to estimate the approximate cost of a person's health insurance based on the given variables. The project involves data analysis, preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter optimization, and model evaluation.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance

## Project Overview

1. **Importing Required Libraries**: Import necessary libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Sklearn for data analysis and modeling.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze the dataset to gain insights.
   - Examine distribution of BMI (Body Mass Index).
   - Study the relationships between various features (e.g., "smoker" and "charges").
   - Use data visualization techniques for better understanding.
   - Summarize observations as comments in the code.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Prepare data for model training.
   - Use Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test).
   - Scale the data using Min-Max Scaling or Standard Scaling.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose multiple regression models and train them using preprocessed data.
   - Evaluate the selected models using cross-validation to understand performance.
   - Select the best performing model based on cross-validation results.

5. **Hyper-parameter Optimization**:
   - Optimize hyperparameters of the selected model.
   - Utilize Grid Search or Randomized Search for parameter tuning.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the optimized model using regression evaluation metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error).
   - Compare the model's performance with the initial models.

## Instructions

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Set up the environment by importing required libraries.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
3. Preprocess the data by handling categorical variables, splitting, and scaling.
4. Select and train regression models, evaluate using cross-validation.
5. Optimize hyperparameters of the best model.
6. Evaluate the optimized model's performance using evaluation metrics.

Feel free to customize and expand upon the project as needed. Have fun exploring and analyzing the data to create an accurate health insurance cost estimation model!
